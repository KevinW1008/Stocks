Having fun with stocks and ploting them. Later will play around.

# Webpage (Front-end)

* Includes one new directory ReactSandbox
* Primarily a mix of javascript using JSX and the React library and good old HTML/CSS. Still in development
* Will require the python code as a backend, and Flask to help with that transition (to be implemented later)

To run, you will need to properly download the appropriate enviroment (instructions below). You will only need to follow Steps 3 and 4. Then you can git pull the ReactSandbox in and remove whatever the default package is

I would highly reccomend you go by the way of Ubuntu, but there is also a Windows option if you are so inclined

There are also some useful websites to catch up on how all this works. I will also be adding in documentation as the design is finalized and more complicated material is added in. 

To run the simulation, go to `/website/`, and run the command `npm start` to see the website. It is also possible to modify files in the public and src directories (which contain the HTML/CSS/Javascript that make up the website) and see changes in real time while the website is running.
