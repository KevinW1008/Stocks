# Stocks
Having fun with stocks and ploting them. Later will play around.

# Webpage (Front-end)

* Includes one new directory ReactSandbox
* Primarily a mix of javascript using JSX and the React library and good old HTML/CSS. Still very much in development
* Will require the python code as a backend, and Flask to help with that transition (to be implemented later)

To run, you will need to properly download the appropriate enviroment (instructions below). Then you can git pull the ReactSandbox in.

I would highly reccomend you go by the way of Ubuntu

There are also some useful websites to catch up on how all this works. I will also be adding in documentation as the design is finalized and more complicated material is added in.
